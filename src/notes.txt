- Preprocessing
	- Todo:
		- Extra filtering by either: looking all pixels in frame (maybe count green pixels, as suggested in iCorsi) or dropping frames adjoined to currently dropped frames
		- Fine tune thresholds and try to make faster (check less pixels, only relevant pixels)

- Reconstruct camera
	- Todo:
		- Document real dimensions of the table (look up manufacturer/wiki/event organizer/rules)
		- Extract image points corresponding to:  corners (holes), cushings/table edges, ball markers/reference lines in the playing area, balls in initial position
		- DLT, sketch is done, needs to be encapsulated/"made into a function"
	- Tips:

- Reconstruct ball position
	- Todo:
		- Track balls (frame by frame) general guess
		- Extract refined contour/silhouette of the ball (detect shadow and specular light reflection)
		- Reconstruct 3D ball center position
	- Tips:
		- Track the specular reflection with color masking (convolution?)
		- Solve the geometry light reflection problem, using the known ball position in the reference frame to first calibrate the light


- Final visualization
	- Todo:
		- Given the world coordinates of all relevant objects, render a top down view.
		- Geometries include segments (rectangles) and circles and a half circle (balls and one of the reference lines)
